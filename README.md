Prompt-Flow is a library that enables seamless integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT model into command-line interfaces (CLIs) through piping. It empowers users to generate prompts, receive AI-generated responses, and execute code or view diagrams directly from the command line, enhancing productivity and creative workflows.

## Usage example

## Installation 
To install Prompt-Flow, cd into the directory and run `npm install`. To configure it, create a `openai_credentials.json` file in the root folder, with two fields: `apiKey` and `orgId` from your OpenAi account.

## Executables
After installing and configuring Prompt-Flow, you can take advantage of 'npm run executables' to run commands (from everywhere)
 `echo 'hello world with a great twist! ' | code | ai | execute` 
instead of 
`echo 'hello world with a great twist! ' | ./engine/code.js | ./engine/ai.js | ./engine/execute.js`
in the directory of installation.

1. Run the command `npm run executables` in your terminal.
2. Ensure that your system's PATH includes the directory where the Prompt-Flow executable resides (/engine).
